Dear {{ review.submitter.name }},

Congratulations! The peer review of your model [{{ release.title }}]({{ release_url }}) is now complete and your release has been marked as peer reviewed. Your release will remain private until you [publish it yourself]({{release_publish_url}}). DOIs are automatically minted for peer reviewed, published models but may take up to a day to be fully registered. If your model still has not been issued a DOI after being published after 24 hours or you encounter any issues please feel free to [contact us]({{ build_absolute_uri(slugurl('contact')) }}).

Thank you for submitting your computational model for review to CoMSES Net! Please consider serving as a reviewer of model code in future model peer reviews.

Best regards,
The CoMSES Net Editors
