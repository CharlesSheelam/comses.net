        <i class='fas fa-exclamation-triangle'></i> Peer reviews must be requested on
        <strong>unpublished model releases</strong> so that you can continue to revise your submission based on
        reviewer guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have already published your model <strong>a new draft release will be created</strong> as an
        exact copy of your most recent published release. If your model successfully passes peer review you can then
        choose to publish the reviewed release as the latest version.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0">
        <b>
            Once a model release passes peer review, uploaded files can no longer be modified,
            though metadata will remain editable.
        </b>
    </p>
</div>
<p>Before submitting your peer review request, please ensure that your model conforms to the following
    <a href="/reviews/" target="_blank">review criteria</a>:
</p>
<ul class="mb-4">
    <li>
        <strong>Has "clean" source code</strong> that uses meaningful variable, method, and/or class names, is
        well-structured and consistently formatted for readability, has thorough comments that describe the
        semantics and intent of the code, and is in general
        <q cite='https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-05004-4'>as simple as possible but no simpler</q>. The
        ideal goal we are striving for here is to make it as easy as possible for others (including your future self) to
        understand your code.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Has detailed narrative documentation</strong> containing equations, flowcharts, or other
        diagrams in a structured format like the
        <a href="https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=40429" target="_blank">ODD protocol</a> or
        equivalent. We <strong>do not recommend submitting a published journal article</strong> as your model's
        narrative documentation as they are often not detailed enough to allow others to fully reproduce your model
        and pose copyright issues for us to host.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is easily runnable</strong> without substantive changes to the downloaded package. Make sure to remove
        any absolute paths (e.g., <code>/home/twubc/project/psyche/2023-01-14/data/hurn.nc</code> or
        <code>C:\Users\twubc\Downloads\data\ferns-and-wells.zip</code> or <code>/Users/twubc/data/ferns.nc</code>)
        from your source code and read the following note carefully for more details on how to reference any data
        files you upload to the Computational Model Library.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="alert bg-gray" role="alert">
    <p><strong>Note on Uploaded Data</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-0">CoMSES Net stores uploaded data files in <code>&lt;project-root&gt;/data/</code> and code in
        <code>&lt;project-root&gt;/code/</code>. This means that your model will need to reference uploaded data
        files via a relative path like <code>"../data/my-input-data.csv"</code>. If you uploaded a zipfile with a
        nested directory structure you may need to go up several directories to get to the project root before
        descending back down into the data directory, depending on where your source code files exist within that nested
        directory structure. For example, a Python script in a <code>src/python/</code> directory would have to
        reference uploaded data files in <code>"../../../data/"</code>). This limitation can be sidestepped by including
        your data in your source code zipfile and referencing relative paths to your input data directly in your code
        and ignoring the CoMSES data upload slot.
