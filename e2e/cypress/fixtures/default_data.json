The goal of this event is to bring together sophisticated work in philosophy of science and on-going efforts in modeling in order to build more effective collaboration between philosophers of science and those who build and employ models in a range of disciplines and applications.\n\nTopics will include:\n\n- The scientific status of computational techniques\n- Does simulation require a new epistemology?\n- The role of theory, experiment, model, and simulation\n- Varieties and purposes of scientific simulation\n- Analytic modeling versus computer simulation\n- Problems of juggling multiple and competing models\n- How do models fail?\n- Validation and verification of models and simulations\n- Promises and pitfalls of large, detailed, and realistic models",
